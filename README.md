Hi

If you are wondering what this project is about, then let me explain.

This is the sample project for my talk **"E-Commerce Automation for DevOps Pros (with Buddy and Shopware 6)".**
It was part of the Webinar that I was allowed to do with Buddy (thanks for that).

The project contains all setups from that webinar.


## Installation

You can easily install the project by just starting docker.
Navigate to the project folder and run this command (if you have Docker already installed).

```ruby 
docker-compose up -d
```



After the image has been downloaded and started, you should be able to see a Shopware 6 shop when you navigate to
`http://localhost` in your browser.


## What projects are there?
There are 3 different projects.
One is a simple plugin, one a full customized shop and the third one is a plain Shopware App backend services.




Have fun!
Hope to see you at my next talk.
